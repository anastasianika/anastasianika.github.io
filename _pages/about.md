Anastasia Nika is a Chemist PhD, with scientific interests in Microelectronics and micro/nano technologies. She is focused on the design and development of novel materials for lithographic applications, chemocapacitive sensors and advanced bioprinting technologies. Also, familiar with fundamental research methods, 
including: UV-VIS and IR spectroscopy, AFM, SEM, DSC, HPLC, <sup>1</sup>HNMR, contact angle.
  
Her research interests include the design and characterization of 
polymers, the evaluation of photosensitive materials for lithographic 
applications (top-down and bottom-up), surface modification for 
bio-applications, and design of biocompatible materials for 3D 
bioprinting.
