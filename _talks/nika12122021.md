**Abstract**

A critical aspect to the development of micro- and nanoscale arrays and biosensors is the ability
to immobilize biomolecules onto a surface with high resolution. The chemistry and the topography
of the patterned surfaces can also be used to control the size and the structure of cells attached to
them, thus affecting cell behavior [1].

Patterning techniques using optical lithography and electron beam lithography are not suitable
methods for such applications since they are using harsh solvents that are not bio-compatible,
leading to denaturation of biomolecules. To overcome this obstacle, fluorinated photoresists that
can be developed with biomolecule friendly solvents (hydrofluoroethers) have been proposed [2].

In this work, fluorinated homopolymers and copolymers were synthesized by free radical
polymerization and evaluated as surfaces with the ability to be modified under UV irradiation for
selective biomolecules patterning. Novel 4-vinylbenzyl glycidyl ether-co-pentafluophenyl
methacrylate copolymers were synthesized and their response to UV irradiation in the presence of
a photoacid generator was evaluated especially in terms of hydrophilicity change.
